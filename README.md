# Course-Scheduling

The mission of Course Scheduling is to output usable schedules to University students using a database filled in by the faculty, administrators and staff. We aim to quickly create schedules and take users through an intuitive process of filling in the necessary information to get their desired schedule. The end product will be an exportable schedule that a user can edit in order to adapt to their specific needs.
